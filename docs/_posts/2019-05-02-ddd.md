Discussions take many forms, but when your discussions are intended to reach decisions they become deliberations.
<!--more-->

The key is that deliberations that don't produce decisions are failures. 
Think of a deadlocked jury - if a jury can't agree on a verdict, then the case has to be retried. 
That might aid the accused, but it's a waste of time and money otherwise.

Because deliberations have a goal, 
it's very important to have a good idea at all times how close the deliberation is to reaching that goal. 
Very few of the tools that we have help us determine that.

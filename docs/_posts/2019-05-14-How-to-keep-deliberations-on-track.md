Keeping deliberations on track is a skill that you can learn...
<!--more-->
If I ask you what word comes to mind when you hear the word "deliberations"
I fear that many of you will reply with the words "deadlocked", "stalled" or "failed".

It's hard to get people to reach consensus on "what to do" about just about any non-trivial issue -
 and folks can end up more polarized after deliberating a topic than ther were before discussing it.

How can we prevent that, or at least lessen the chances that we're going to "make it worse" 
by trying to resolve pressing issues?

That's the question that I'm trying to answer with Trules... 
Can tools help our deliberations bear fruit?

I've collaborated on countless decisions, 
and I've help facilitate group that couldn't reach consensus...
so I guess I'm an expert.

I've learned some techniques and I've learned some rules 
that will help you reach consensus (when that's possible)
and will help avoid "making things worse" (when consensus isn't possible).

Trules is built to make following these techniques and rules easier, 
but they're not that hard to apply.

To begin, deliberations are discussions that have a goal.
To avoid disruptions, delays and deadlocks keep the focus on the goal.

Organize, Summarize, Publicize

Discussions can be wide-ranging, wandering and circuitous 
 but deliberations can't (or they'll fail). 

Participants need to have a bit of discipline with their
contributions to stick to the topic... 
and that can be very hard unless they're constantly reminded
what the goal of the deliberation is *at this time*.

That's a crucial realization - 
the goal of a deliberation will change often change as 
more is learned and shared about the topic.

Keeping deliberations on track is a skill that you can learn...
<!--more-->

If I ask you what word comes to mind when you hear the word "deliberations"
I fear that many of you will reply with the words "deadlocked", "stalled" or "failed".

It's hard to get people to reach consensus on "what to do" about just about any non-trivial issue -
 and folks can end up more polarized after deliberating a topic than they were before discussing it.

Can we prevent deliberation deadlocks, or at least lessen the chances that we're going to "make it worse" 
by trying to resolve contentious issues?

I think we can, and that's why I'm building Trules... 

I've collaborated on countless decisions, 
and I've help facilitate many groups that couldn't reach consensus without outside help...
so I guess I'm an expert.

I've learned some techniques and I've learned some rules 
that will help you reach consensus (when that's possible)
and that will help you avoid "making things worse" (when consensus isn't possible).

Trules is built to make following these techniques and rules easier, 
but they're not that hard to apply on your own (tedious, but not hard).

To begin, always remember that deliberations are discussions that have a goal.
To avoid disruptions, delays and deadlocks you have to keep the focus on the goal.
Discussions can be wide-ranging, wandering and circuitous 
but deliberations can't (or they'll fail). 

Stick to the Topic

Participants need to have a bit of discipline to keep their
contributions on topic - 
and that can be very hard unless they're constantly reminded
about what the goal of the deliberation is *at this time*.

To keep the deliberations on track, 
you've got to clearly state and share the goals of the deliberation, 
and update those goals as they become clearer.

That's a crucial point to keep in mind - 
the goal of a deliberation are often refined and changed as 
more is shared and learned about the topic.

As discussion progress, you may realize that there
are underlying topics that have to be considered
before you can tackle the "primary" topic.
That's okay, and it's to be expected.

Make sure that folks are always aware of what the
goals of the deliberations are *at this time*.

Organize, Summarize, Publicize

In order to stay on topic (when the topic is likely to change)
requires summarizing the discussions.

If each participant has to read through a transcript of the entire
discussion, then you're almost assured that they'll develop different
understandings about what's transpired. 
They'll miss exchanges, read them out of order, etc. 
They're not being malicious or lazy, 
it's just what happens when you read through a lot of messages.

To avoid this, product and keep up to date a summary of the discussion.
That can be hard, but it's easier if you apply the following techniques.

As comments are made, organize them into categories and themes.

For example, when a question has been posed group all of the responses related to that question together.

Some responses might be requests for clarification (they weren't sure what the question was asking).
Other responses are likely proposed answers. 
These proposed answers could be invalid 
(they're not answering the question), 
or they could be partial answers, 
or they could be perfect answers (that hardly ever happens).
Answers will require checking, folks will differ on the value of answers, etc.

Group all these responses together, and organize them in the most effective manner to convey
what the state of consensus is *at this time*.

The organized Q&A should be an easy to read presentation of what's been said that is as clear as it can be.

Once you've organized the responses, then you need to summarize them.

Conciseness is your most powerful tool for building consensus.
Every word and phrase is subject to misinterpretation, so the fewer words the better.

Note that there is a real danger (almost a certainty) that your summary will be biased.
For that reason, set up procedures for those who might disagree with your summary to express 
and incorporate their concerns as objectively as possible.

Once you're happy with your summary, hide the "raw" transcript and focus subsequent discussions on the summary.
This leads everyone towards consensus, 
because there's a shared context of "where we are" in relation to "reaching our goal".
As you get closer to the goal, the best steps to get to it become clearer.

That's really all there is to it:
- Organize the discussion. 
- Summarize the discussion. 
- Publicize the summary.

The hard part is that you have to do this frequently as the deliberations progress -
and that's were a tool like Trules can help.

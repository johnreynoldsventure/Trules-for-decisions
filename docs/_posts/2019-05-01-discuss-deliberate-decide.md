Discussions take many forms, but when your discussions are intended to reach decisions they become deliberations.

You've got *a great idea*.

You **discuss** the idea with others because it's a *great idea*.

If your collaborators agree that you've got a *great idea*, then you'll want to act on the idea...

When that happens, you'll **delibrate** the idea with your collaborators to work out what the options are for acting on your *great idead*.

Finally, you'll **decide** what to do about your *great idea*, and live happily ever after.

**Discussions** lead to **Deliberations** lead to **Decisions**

Wouldn't it be great if that's what really happened when you get a *great idea*?

<h1>de·lib·er·a·tion</h1>
noun <br/> /dəˌlibəˈrāSH(ə)n/ <br/>
1. long and careful consideration or discussion.
"after much deliberation we arrived at a decision"

Deliberations have goals. You're spending time discussing a topic because you need to make decisions.
If you don't reach decisions, you've wasted your time.

## [Trules®](https://trules.app) helps deliberations produce decisions.

Deliberating decisions can be hard, and trying to reach decisions online makes it even harder.

Web conferencing tools falls short because folks can seldom meet at the same time - scheduling conflicts are all too common and people get interrupted constantly.

Texting and email tools fall short because people are busy, distracted and multitasking - folks often miss posts or read them out of order, and that leads to circuitous threads and misunderstandings.

[Trules®](https://trules.app) was built to solve those problems.

[Trules®](https://trules.app) helps you harvest the relevant information from your deliberations, summarize that information for analysis and evaluation, reach consensus and present the decisions to those who need to know.

# de·lib·er·a·tion
noun
/dəˌlibəˈrāSH(ə)n/
1. long and careful consideration or discussion.
"after much deliberation we arrived at a decision"

Deliberations have goals. You're spending time discussing a topic because you need to make decisions.
If you don't reach decisions the deliberation has failed.

[Trules®](https://trules.app) helps deliberations succeed.

Deliberating decisions can be hard, and trying to reach decisions online makes it even harder.

Web conferencing falls short because folks can't meet at the same time - scheduling conflicts are all too common and people get interrupted constantly.

Texting and email fall short because people are busy, distracted and multitasking - folks often miss posts or read them out of order, and that leads to circuitous threads and misunderstandings.

[Trules®](https://trules.app) was built to solve those problems.

[Trules®](https://trules.app) helps you harvest the relevant information from your discussion, organize that information for evaluation, and vote on decisions.

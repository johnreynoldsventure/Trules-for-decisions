<h1>de·lib·er·a·tion</h1>
noun <br/> /dəˌlibəˈrāSH(ə)n/ <br/>
1. long and careful consideration or discussion.
"after much deliberation we arrived at a decision"

Deliberations have goals. You're spending time discussing a topic because you need to make decisions.
If you don't reach decisions, you've wasted your time.

## [Trules®](https://trules.app) helps deliberations produce decisions.

Deliberating decisions can be hard, and trying to reach decisions online makes it even harder because people are busy, distracted and multitasking.

**Web conferencing tools** fall short because folks can seldom meet at the same time, they can't meet for long enough to decide, and they are constantly interrupted when they can meet.

**Texting and email tools** fall short because folks often miss posts, read them out of order or post off-topic replies - all of which often leads to simple misunderstandings, circuitous discussions and wasted time.

**[Trules®](https://trules.app)** was built to solve those problems.

[Trules®](https://trules.app) helps you harvest the relevant information from your deliberations, summarize that information for analysis and evaluation, reach consensus and present your decisions to everyone who needs to know.

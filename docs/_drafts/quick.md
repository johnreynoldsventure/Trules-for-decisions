The skill to quickly make decisions is one that you'll have to master if you want to run your own business…
As a new Small Business Owner, I struggled to keep pace with the deluge of decisions that I have to make, and until I had a "eureka" moment I almost drowned.
My "eureka" was that my decisions are products. My crucial and irreplaceable job as the business owner is to produce good decisions so that my team can execute them.
If I produce good decisions, then my ¿?Trules business will survive and thrive. If I don't produce good decisions, then it's early retirement for me and glowing recommendations for those who've helped me.
With that insight, I suddenly grokked that my decisions are the most important product for my business to survive… and I needed to approach making those decisions in the same way as I tackle the production of any other product.
I need to make decisions like a Product Manager makes products
Prior to starting my own business, I had been a Product Manager at many software firms, and I was pretty darn good at it (in my less than humble opinion)
If you want to be a great Product Manager you need to learn a variety of skills, but somewhere at the top of the list is this:
You need to focus on building Minimal Viable Products
The mix of features and user experience in your product's release has to be viable (people can use it to solve the problem) - but the product also has to be minimal to ensure that you aren't expending any more effort than necessary before getting real feedback from real users.
Your time and money is precious, and you won't really know that you've built what users want until they tell you.
Build something that solves a specific problem for people, and then listen for the people to tell you what other problems they need to solve…
Tying those two threads together:
My products are Decisions
I should strive to produce Minimum Viable Products

Let's call this making Minimum Viable Decisions for brevity…
I need to make good decisions, and I need to make decisions quickly. Until I decide, my team can't execute.
But: My decisions don't need to be perfect, they just need to "solve" a specific problem ("What do we do about this?")
Simple, focuses decisions are much easier to execute than complex ones.
The issues that I face as a small business owner are often complex - and simple decisions won't solve them - but a quickly executed simple decision will advance us one step further towards solving the complex problem.
Just as with other Minimum Viable Products, the Minimum Viable Decision gets something "out there" for people to use - and gives us the data that we need to plan our next move.
Make a "small" decision that solves a specific part of the complex problem, and then evaluate the decision's effect to guide you towards solving the remaining problems…
Rather than agonizing, break the problem down and tackle the smallest "viable" part of the problem to tackle.
Decide what to do, execute the decision, monitor the outcome - and move on to producing the next "viable" decision.
This combination of "Decision Maker" with "Product Manager" really saved my sanity as a new business owner - I hope it helps you too.
